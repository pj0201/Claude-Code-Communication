  "question": "LINE Auto-Detection Failure Report: Unix Socket implementation FAILED. LINE Bridge reports success but Claude Code receives nothing. Socket server started (bash_id 14), LINE message sent, Bridge logs show success and socket notification sent, but socket server output is NOTHING (BashOutput shows running but no data). Claude Code session sees NOTHING. Root cause: Background processes cannot push output to Claude Code CLI session. Please analyze: 1) Why did this approach fail technically? 2) Research how other CLI tools achieve real-time notifications (GitHub CLI gh issue notifications, kubectl watch mode, Docker CLI container events, tmux/screen integration patterns). 3) Alternative approaches (tmux split-pane integration, Named Pipes FIFO with blocking read, HTTP polling with user-prompt-submit hook, sidecar process patterns). 4) Fundamental question: Is auto-detection technically POSSIBLE given Claude Code CLI passive nature? Constraints: Claude Code CLI is passive interactive, background process output invisible, need ZERO user action for true auto-detection, must work reliably 100% of the time.",
